    <h3>For Dummies, by dummies XD</h3>
    <p>
        This site will contain my progress in relearning Web Development and the issues I will encounter in the
        tutorials found online.
        Don't you just hate it when they say just do X, when X is an extremely complicated step?
        I intend to re-write the tutorials that I will study but adding the small but significant details that guru's
        tend to skip.
